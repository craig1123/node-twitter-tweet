# node-twitter-tweet

A node based Twitter bot that will tweet daily programming challenges to https://twitter.com/365daysofcode. Hosted by Heroku

## Contributing Challenges

1. Find a programming challenge. Good places to look:
  * https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges
  * https://www.codewars.com/
  * https://medium.com/@programmertoni/1000-hours-of-coding-challenges-in-a-year-eb8dc4f3de41
  * Make your own!

2. Add your challenge to the BOTTOM of the array.
  * Each line is a day of the year. array[0] is Jan 1, array[31] is Feb. 1
  * If we ever have more challenges than number of days in a year, we'll make challenges2018.js, challenges2019.js, etc.

3. Follow the requirements below:
  * The challenge has to be something that can be programmed.
  * Inlcude an example solution for clarification
  * Make sure the text is no more than 265 characters long (as I append #365daysofcode to the end).
    * Twitter won't accept it and I'll get an email saying that the string is too long.
