/*
  NOTE: HOW TO ADD CHALLENGES
  ---------------------------

  1. Find a programming challenge. Good places to look:
    * https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges
    * https://www.codewars.com/
    * https://medium.com/@programmertoni/1000-hours-of-coding-challenges-in-a-year-eb8dc4f3de41
    * Make your own!

  2. Add your challenge to the BOTTOM of the array.
    * Each line is a day of the year. array[0] is Jan 1, array[31] is Feb. 1
    * If we ever have more challenges than number of days in a year, we'll make challenges2018.js, challenges2019.js, etc.

  3. Follow the requirements below:
    * The challenge has to be something that can be programmed.
    * Inlcude an example solution for clarification
    * Make sure the text is no more than 265 characters long (as I append #365daysofcode to the end).
      * Twitter won't accept it and I'll get an email saying that the string is too long.
